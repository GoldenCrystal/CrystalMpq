		<h1>CrystalMpq</h1>
		<h2>By <a href="http://www.yaronet.com/blogs/GoldenCrystal">GoldenCrystal</a>, Updated for WoW 3.1.1</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>What is it ?</dt>
			<dd>CrystalMpq is a C# library designed to open <acronym title="MoPAQ">MPQ</acronym> archives. 
				It still doesn't support all compression types, but most files should open 
				correctly. <acronym title="World of Warcraft">WoW</acronym> Archives don&#39;t use 
				the older compression types and should never encounter any problems. Older game 
				archives such as Warcraft III archives might use unsupported compressions (such 
				as ADPCM or Huffman that aren&#39;t supported yet), meaning that some files might be 
				unreadable by CrystalMpq for the time being.<br />
				Some applications were developped along with the library and are part of the 
				package. They should allow you to peek into your favorite Blizzard MMORPG&#39;s 
				archives. Older game&#39;s archives should work fine as long as you don&#39;t want to 
				access WAVE data.</dd>
			<dt>Conditions</dt>
			<dd>This software is delivered "as-is". You are free not to use it. If you choose to use it, the author shall not
			be held responsible for any consequences to the (mis)usage of the software.</dd>
			<dt>Requirements</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>Windows 98 or later</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5">Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9226a611-62fe-4f61-aba1-914185249413">DirectX 9.0c (for Audio/Video visualization)</a></li>
					<li>Managed DirectX Runtime (for Audio/Video visualization)</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt>How to install</dt>
			<dd>Unpack the whole archive to a directory of your choice, and ensure that you meet 
				the above requirements.<br />
				You might find it useful to run the dxwebsetup.exe tool. It will update your 
				DirectX installation by downloading needed files directly from Microsoft&#39;s site.</dd>
			<dt>Applications included in the package</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>CrystalMpqExplorer: An explorer-style interface designed to browse MPQ files and their content.</li>
					<li>DbcViewer: A simple user interface application that lets you open separate WoW DBC files.</li>
					<li>WoWMapExplorer: A simple World Map viewer mimicking the World Map feature of WoW.</li>
					<li>WoWSpellViewer: A basic interface for browing WoW Spells. Still Work in progress.</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt>Known issues</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>There is a bug (leading to a crash) if you ever try to open BLP textures smaller than 4x4 pixels.
					It's just a stupid buffer overflow bug but i'm too lazy to fix it for now. I'll have to rewrite most of the texture loading code at some point anyway, so it'll probably be done at the same time.
					Because of this bug, loading of mipmaps in BLP Textures is disabled.</li>
					<li>The DBC viewer can be quite memory hungry because of the usage of .NET 2.0's DataGridView control.
					Please note that trying to open files too large may easily lead your computer to run out of free memory and degrade considerably your user experience.<br />
						This remarks apply particularly to the file &quot;Spell.dbc&quot; that has now grown over 
						40 MB and cannot be viewed anymore, sorry. For your convenience, a warning has 
						been added to the DBC viewer to prevent you from viewing too large files. You 
						are free to bypass this warning, but be aware that it might be a really bad idea 
						for some files, and I advise you never to bypass it for the &quot;Spell.dbc&quot; file.<br />
						Anyway, I canot be held responsible for any consequences of the bypass of this 
						warning...</li>
					<li>Missing (known) compression types: ADPCM, Huffman</li>
					<li>It is not possible to manually pick a WoW installation directory for now...</li>
					<li>Some parts of the code are really old, and may need some refactoring or event 
						complete rewriting, and thus, some &quot;small&quot; features might need more work than 
						expected to implement.</li>
				</ul>
			</dd>
			<dt>Source Code</dt>
			<dd>
				Currently, the source code is not available, but I plan to make it available sometime in the future (might be tomorrow as it might be in five years...)
				Since I started this project a long time ago, there are some parts of the code that are really ugly (there shouldn't be many left tough).
				Particularly, the WoW Map Explorer (which is one of the best application in this package ! :p) was written mainly for testing purposes, and would need a complete rewrite
				now that the code is stable and known to work.
				If ever released, the code should be released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-rl.html">Ms-RL</a> License.
			</dd>
			<dt>For developers</dt>
			<dd>
				You are free to use the CrystalMpq library along with the CrystalMpq.Utility and CrystalMpq.WoWFile librairies in your project.
				Just give credit to the author for these. :)<br />
				I don't consider the API stable, so I don't provide the documentation for now. If you want to use them you'll have to figure out how 
				they work, but it shouldn't be really hard. ;)
